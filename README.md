# Abacus
A very simple calculator which displays the answer in the form of a Suanpan abacus drawn with ASCII characters.
Programmed and demo'd at TerribleHack XIII, March 10 2019.

This calculator takes 2 integer values and can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents.
You can customize the size of the abacus, as long as it can hold the value (Currently only displays using the Suanpan abacus).
